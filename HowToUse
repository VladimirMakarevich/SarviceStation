To work with the database used by the FE code Firstov technology. 
To create and work with a database, you need to install SQL EXPRESS on  local machine.
Since the first launch of the application, the test itself is initializing a database and create the necessary tables. 
The only thing you need to paying attention to this connection string. 
The basis of the connection string is as follows: 

<add name="ServiceDbContext" connectionString="Data Source=.\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=ServiceStation;integrated security=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;App=EntityFramework" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />

IMPORTANT!
login and password for an application: intetics/intetics

As for dealing with errors and I used NLog and Elman, they just need to change the connection string to the database. 
To create a database to NLog and ELMAH, run this ServiceStationSQL. 
NLog connection string to find in the NLog.config file. ELMAH connection string to find in the Web.config
