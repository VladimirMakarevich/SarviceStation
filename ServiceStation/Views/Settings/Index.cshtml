            <p>
                To work with the database used by the FE code Firstov technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                To create and work with a database, you need to install SQL EXPRESS on  local machine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the first launch of the application, the test itself is initializing a database and create the necessary tables.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only thing you need to paying attention to this connection string.
            </p>
            <p> The basis of the connection string is as follows:

            <p>
                <add name="ServiceDbContext" connectionString="Data Source=.\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=ServiceStation;integrated security=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;App=EntityFramework" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
            </p>
            <p>
                As for dealing with errors and I used NLog and Elman, they just need to change the connection string to the database.
            </p>
            <p>
                To create a database to NLog and ELMAH, run this ServiceStationSQL.
            </p>
            <p>
                NLog connection string to find in the NLog.config file. ELMAH connection string to find in the Web.config
            </p>

                <a href="@Url.Action("Contact", "Settings")" class="btn btn-info btn-lg"> Contact with Us</a>
            </p>
